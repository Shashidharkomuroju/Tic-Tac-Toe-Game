# TIC-TAC-TOE Game


A Tic Tac Toe game built with React involves creating components to represent the game board and individual squares, managing game state to track player turns and square values, implementing game logic to determine a winner, and handling user interactions through event handling. It's a great project for learning React fundamentals like component structure, state management, and rendering.
